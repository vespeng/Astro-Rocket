# Local preview of the built site, in two stages.
#
# The build stage installs dependencies and runs `astro build`. The runtime
# stage is nginx with the generated files copied in — no Node, no pnpm, no
# Astro, and none of the dependency tree.
#
# Two things this is good for:
#
#   Trying the theme without installing anything but Docker. `docker compose
#   up --build` and the site is on localhost:4321.
#
#   Keeping `pnpm install` away from your own machine. Installing a
#   dependency tree runs other people's install scripts; here they run in a
#   container that can see this repository and nothing else of yours.
#
# It is not how you deploy. See the README for that — the theme builds for
# Vercel, Netlify and Cloudflare, and only those builds carry the API routes.
